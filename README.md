Housing Price Regression Model
Overview
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The analysis involves data exploration, feature engineering, and training a regression model to understand the factors that influence the sale price of a home.

Dependencies
This notebook requires the following Python libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib.pyplot

seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

Data
